<p1>I've created this tool to practice memorizing Japanese characters in both Hiragana and Katakana. This is just a simple program that randomly picks from hiragana/katakana, you enter the sound that the character makes and it will keep track of how many characters you've gotten correct and gotten wrong.</p1>
